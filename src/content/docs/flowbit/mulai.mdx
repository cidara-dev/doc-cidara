###### Flowbite is technically a plugin that can be included into any existing Tailwind CSS project. To get started, you first need to make sure that you have a working Tailwind CSS project installed and that you also have Node and NPM installed on your machine.

### Require via NPM 

##### Install the latest version of Flowbite using NPM:

```sh
npm install flowbite
```

##### Include Flowbite as a plugin inside the *tailwind.config.js* file:

```sh
module.exports = {

    plugins: [
        require('flowbite/plugin')
    ]

}
```

##### Additionally to your own content data you should add flowbite to apply the classes from the interactive elements in the *tailwind.config.js* file:
```sh
module.exports = {

    content: [
        "./node_modules/flowbite/**/*.js"
    ]

}
```

##### Require the JavaScript code that powers the interactive elements before the end of your ```<body>``` tag:
```sh
<script src="../path/to/flowbite/dist/flowbite.min.js"></script>
```

### Include via CDN #

If you want to quickly test out Flowbite you can easily include the following CSS and JavaScript files.

Require the following minified stylesheet inside the ```<head>``` tag:
```sh
<link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowbite/2.1.1/flowbite.min.css"  rel="stylesheet" />
```
And include the following javascript file before the end of the ```<body>``` element:
```sh
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowbite/2.1.1/flowbite.min.js"></script>
```

###### *Please remember that the best way to work with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite is by purging the CSS classes.*

### Bundled JavaScript #

One of the most popular way of using Flowbite is to include the bundled Javascript file which is UMD ready using a bundler such as Webpack or Parcel which makes sure that all of the data attributes and functionality will work out-of-the-box.

You can directly import the main JavaScript file inside your bundled ***app-bundle.js*** file like this:
```sh
import 'flowbite';
```
